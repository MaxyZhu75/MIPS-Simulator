# MIPS-Simulator
This assignment requires a simple 5 stage pipelined machine to be simulated. The simulator should be capable of implementing the MIPS architecture on a cycle by cycle basis. The simulator must be cycle accurate with respect to contents of the registers, but need not be faithful to other hardware details such as control signals. The output of the simulator, in addition to the register contents and latch values should include the utilization factor of each functional unit and the total time in cycles to execute a set of instructions. Implement the simulator according to the specifications described below in C++.
